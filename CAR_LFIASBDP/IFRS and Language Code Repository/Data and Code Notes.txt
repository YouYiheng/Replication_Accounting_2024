The code in this repository makes use of hand-collected data from the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) website, as well as the following providers of publicly available data: CIA World Factbook, International Monetary Fund, The World Bank, Educational Testing Service, Geert Hofstede, Deloitte's IASPlus.net, Joshi and Lahiri (2015), and Compustat.

Text-based measures of comment letters to construct the variables Originality and WritingQuality were developed in R (using "R1. IASB CLs - Uniqueness and Similarity by ED.R") and using an algorithm we developed for uploading comment letters to Grammarly.

Except for the variables Originality and WritingQuality, all variables were constructed in STATA using data downloaded from the sources indicated above and in the accompanying .do files. 

The map figures were produced in R using "R2. IASB CLs - Map Figures.R."

The file "S0. IASB CLs - Compile Data.do" is used to import data downloaded from the indicated sources and transform the data in preparation for the analyses in the subsequently numbered .do files.

The file "S1. IASB CLs - By-Country Tests.do" was used to construct the dataset used in the analyses presented in Tables 1 through 3 and OA.4.

The file "S2. IASB CLs - Diff-in-Diff ED Translation Tests.do" was used to construct the dataset used in the analyses presented in Table 4.

The file "S3. IASB CLs - By-CL and Path Analyses.do" was used to construct the dataset used in the analyses presented in Tables 5 through 8.

The file "S4. IASB CLs - Advisory Council Tests.do" was used to construct the dataset used in the analyses presented in Table 9.
